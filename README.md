## Technologies used
## Game
You play as an outlaw duck which has been captured by a higher entity. Captured to play an inter-dimensional
basketball to the death. You have control of a duck. All the ducks are placed on the platform on which they must
stay to survive.

As this is an inter-dimensional basketball whenever the basketball is dribbled it becomes a flaming menace for the
limited amount of time. When this ball touches the character that character loses health.
Because those inter-dimensional beings donâ€™t like a fair game they tend to through power-ups which would allow
players to win by using those power-ups to get an upper hand in this game.
## Game rules

The point of the game is to survive as long as possible and outlive your opponents.
All the players are positioned on the platform which is shrinking over time. If any of the players walk off the
platform then they instantly die.

On the map, there are a number of balls where each of them starts out as safe (meaning that the player can get
hit by the ball without losing health). They are indicated as the basketball.
When a player makes contact with such basketball, this ball turns into red and bounce around the platform with
rather fast speed within limited time and when any player touches such flamming ball, he will lose some of his
health.

The balls are moving around on the straight line in their own with constant speed and bounced off from any other
objects. There are 3 stages of the game:

**First minute of game play** the players have a bigger platform to move around and avoid making contact with
flamming balls

**Second minute of game play** the platform and the wall shrinks, which means the player will have lesser space
to move around so does the balls, it indicates the players have the higher chance to get hit by the ball.

**Third minute of the game play** and beyond the platform and the wall shrinks furthermore, that means it is
very hard for the player to not to get hit by the ball at that point of time. And this is the end of the stage.

In addition, to increases the survivability of the player in the game, there are 3 power-up items provided on the
platform:

**Health recovery** When the player picks it up, he gets full health recovery.

**Time stop** When the player picks it up, the whole world freezes around him within limited time and he can move
around the platform without making contact with the balls.

**Shield** When the player picks it up, he gains a barrier which can prevent him from getting hit by the flaming ball.
The condition to win the game is when only one out of the four players are still standing on the platform.
